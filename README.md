# RyMat

### Note: This add-on is currently in testing.

RyMat is my personal add-on for Blender made to speed up and simplify the material editing workflow within Blender. I've invested well over 2500 hours over the past 4 years designing, programming, researching and testing to make this software a powerful addition to Blender. RyMat can be used to make optimized, professional quality textures for models used in Unity, Unreal Engine, VRChat, and much more. This add-on is free and open-source software, so everyone has the freedom to create.

Cheers!
